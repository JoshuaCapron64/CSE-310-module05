# Overview

I created this program in an attempt to teach myself the Rust language, as well as make a decent tutorial that I can look back on and remember the various basic components of Rust and how they work, should I ever be called upon to use Rust again. This software is just a basic tutorial that uses comments for both the code and the output to explain what is going on and why. Anyone who runs this code and follows along should gain a good understanding of Rust syntax, and Rust's usage of mutable and unmutable variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code along with rustup installed on machine. I also installed the rust-analyzer extension released by The Rust Programming Language, and the anycode-rust extention by Microsoft.

- [Rust/rustup download site](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

# Future Work

- Perhaps go more in depth about the various data types, what they're called with, what each one can and cannot do (specifically how only u32 can be manipulated within loops while u64 cannot, for some reason)
- Find other keywords and appropriately use them in additional loops (such as "continue").
- Maybe actually utilize Cargo and explain that too.
